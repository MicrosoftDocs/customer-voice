# Share a survey as a template

[!include[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

It's easy to share a survey as a template so that other people in your organization can duplicate it and use it as their own. When you make a copy of a survey, the copy exists in your profile. When you share a survey as a template, you create a special link that allows others to duplicate the survey in their own profile, where they can make changes to it. 

Also, when you share a survey as a template, only the structure of the survey is duplicated. No existing response data is carried over to the new survey. 

To share a survey as a template:

1.  Open the survey you want to share.

2.  On the **Create Questions** tab, select **Share** ![share the survey](media/share-survey.png "Share the survey") from the toolbar at the top of the page.

3.  Select **Get a link to duplicate**.

    ![get the link to share the survey as template](media/get-survey-duplicate-link.png "Get the link to share the survey as template")  

4.  Select **Copy** next to the text box that displays the survey URL.

    ![link to share the survey as template](media/survey-duplicate-link.png "Link to share the survey as template")  

5.  Share this link with your intended audience.

6.  When another person navigates to that survey URL, they must select **Duplicate it** at the top or bottom of the survey to create a copy of the survey in their own profile, which they can then modify for their own needs.
