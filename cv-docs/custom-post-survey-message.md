# Customize the post-survey message

A post-survey message is displayed to respondents after they submit a survey. Default content is available for the post-survey message; however, you can add your own content to customize it in accordance with your requirements. You can also add up to four post-survey messages (in addition to the default message) and add conditions to show the appropriate post-survey message based on the response to a question or the value of a variable. The maximum number of characters supported in the message header and message body are 200 and 1,000, respectively.

You can personalize the post-survey message by adding variables in the message header and body. More information: [Add variables in a survey](personalize-survey.md#add-variables-in-a-survey)

You can add formatting to the post-survey message by changing its font style, font size, and color. You can also add a link to the message by selecting **Link** on the formatting toolbar and then adding the link through the link editor. More information: [Format text in a survey](survey-text-format.md)

If you've created a multilingual survey, you can add translations to post-survey messages for each added language. For information about adding languages and translations, go to [Create a multilingual survey](create-multilingual-survey.md).
