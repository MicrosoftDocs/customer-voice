# Sign up for a free trial

Dynamics 365 Customer Voice offers a free 30-day trial. After a quick setup, you will have access to many of the app's key features. After the trial period ends, you'll need a paid license to continue using Dynamics 365 Customer Voice. For information on purchasing Dynamics 365 Customer Voice licenses, go to [Purchase Dynamics 365 Customer Voice](purchase.md).

**To sign up for the trial**

1. Go to [https://dynamics.microsoft.com/customer-voice/overview/](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/customer-voice/overview/) and select the **Get started** button.

   The trial takes a few moments to load, then you can start using the app.


## Experience for a trial or new user

Dynamics 365 Customer Voice uses a Microsoft Dataverse environment to store and manage data. Provisioning an environment typically takes 15 to 60 minutes to complete. While an environment is getting provisioned, some functionalities aren't available, but you can perform minimal operations and explore the product. After the environment is provisioned, all functionalities become available. More information: [What is Dataverse?](/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro) and [Environments overview](/power-platform/admin/environments-overview)

This section lists all the functionality that will be restricted until an environment is provisioned. These restrictions apply:

- Only for the default environment.
- Only for the trial users and the users who purchase Dynamics 365 Customer Voice through Microsoft 365 admin center.

**What can you do while an environment is getting provisioned?**

- See a preview of the out-of-the-box project templates.
- Create a project by using the **Blank** project template.
- Create new surveys within a project.
- Preview a survey.
- View reports (as read-only).
- Select links such as content, videos, and blogs on the **Home** tab.

**What can't you do while an environment is getting provisioned?**

- Send your surveys through email or Power Automate.
- Choose or modify email templates.
- Submit responses while previewing a survey.
- Configure satisfaction metrics.
- Perform actions such as copy, delete, or rename projects and surveys.
