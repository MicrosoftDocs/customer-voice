# About reports

After you receive responses to your survey, you can view and analyze survey results in the **Reports** section in the left pane. You can browse through the combined responses shown in a graphical format or view individual responses given by each respondent. You can export survey results to a CSV file for more in-depth analysis, and you can delete the responses that you don't need anymore. More information: [View survey responses report](survey-report.md)

If you've created satisfaction metrics in your survey, a dashboard is created automatically for each set of metrics, showcasing recent scores and trends across all surveys in a project. You can filter the charts by using the date filter or select a survey for which you want to see the charts. More information: [View satisfaction metrics report](satisfaction-metrics-report.md)
