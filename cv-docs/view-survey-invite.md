# View a survey invitations report

A survey invitation record is created for each survey email that's sent, either manually or with Power Automate. The survey invitations associated with a survey are available on the **Send** tab.

The following survey invitation statistics are displayed in the upper part of the page, and an **Invites tracking** chart is displayed below the statistics:

- **Total invites**: Displays the total number of survey invitations sent.

- **Responded**: Displays the total number of recipients who responded to the survey invitations. 
    
    > [!NOTE] 
    > - The value displayed in this tile does not include responses received through mediums other than email invitation. The value will be different from the number of total responses displayed on the [survey response report](survey-report.md), as it includes responses received through all mediums.
    > - If you [apply a filter](#filter-invitation-details), it is applied on the total number of invitations sent. For example, you've sent 20 invitations last month, but received 10 responses in the last month and 10 responses in the current month. If you apply the filter for the last month, the number of responses will be displayed as 20, as they are the responses received for the invitations sent in the last month. However, the number of responses for the last month will be displayed as 10 in the survey response report, as it shows the responses received in the selected time period.

- **Not responded**: Displays the total number of recipients who haven't responded to the survey invitations. A pie chart is displayed that shows the distribution of survey invitations by status:

    - **Unread**: The survey invitation email wasn't read.

    - **Read**: The survey invitation email was read or opened.

    - **Opened**: The survey was opened, but hasn't been completed yet.

- **Not sent**: Displays the total number of survey invitations that weren't delivered to recipients due to an incorrect email address or other error.

By default, the **Total invites** tile displays details for all statistics. You can view details for a specific statistic by selecting the **All** filter in the **Search** field, and then selecting the option you want.
