# Work with alerts

Alerts are the follow-up activities that are created based on the defined alert rules. Alert rules are defined on satisfaction metrics. Alerts are created based on the values of satisfaction metrics in survey responses. For example, you can create an alert rule to create an alert whenever the Net Promoter Score (NPS) satisfaction metric for a survey response goes below a threshold. More information: [Create an alert rule](#create-an-alert-rule)

Alerts are created at the project level. They help you close the loop with customers by prompting you to take appropriate action based on the feedback that customers provide.

You can view and manage alerts from the **Alerts** report. The report is available under **Reports** on the left pane. More information: [View and manage alerts](#manage-alert-rules)

## Create an alert rule

Alerts are created based on the satisfaction metric values. You can create an alert rule from the **Alerts** report.

1.  Open the project.

2.  On the left pane, select **Alerts** under the **Reports** section.

3.  On the toolbar at the top of the page, select **Create alert rule**.

4.  In the **Create alert rule** panel, provide the following information:

    - **Name**: Enter a name for the alert rule.

    - **Satisfaction metric**: Select the satisfaction metric on which this
        alert needs to be created.

    - **Condition**: Select a condition and its value from the respective
        lists. An alert will be created whenever this condition is true.
