# Customize survey header

You can customize the header of your survey to match your company's branding. This includes changing the style, theme color, background image, and adding a logo. You can change the alignment of the survey's header text, background image in the header, and logo as per your requirement. Also, you can turn off the header if it is not required.

## Turn off survey header

By default, the survey header is displayed. You can turn it off when not needed. For example, when you embed a survey on a web page, you might not want to show the header at all.

1. Open the survey in which you want to turn off the survey header.

2. Hover over the survey header, and then turn off the **Header** toggle in the upper right corner.

    ![Turn off header.](media/header-off-toggle.png "Turn off header")

## Change header style

By default, the header is displayed in a simple style. Dynamics 365 Customer Voice provides a few predefined styles you can choose from. The styles consist of a background image and a default text alignment. When you select a style, the survey's theme is also updated accordingly. However, after applying a style, you can change the background image, text alignment, and theme color. You can also [change the focal point of the background image](#change-focal-point-of-background-image) in the header.

1. Open the survey in which you want to change the header style.

2. Hover over the survey header to see the toolbar.

3. Select **Style**.

4. In the **Choose a style** panel, select one of the predefined styles.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Compact** style has the least header height as compared to other styles. You cannot add a background image to the survey header when you select this style.

## Change header text alignment

You can change the alignment of header text in the combination of the horizontal and vertical alignments. In the horizontal alignment, you can choose the text to be aligned either to the left, center, or right. In the vertical alignment, you can choose the text to be aligned either at the top, middle, or bottom. So, you can position the header text in nine different alignments.

1. Open the survey in which you want to change the alignment of survey header text.

2. Hover over the text to see the alignment toolbar.

    ![Header text alignment.](media/header-text-align.png "Header text alignment")

## Add background image to survey header

## Change focal point of background image

When you select a style or add a background image, the only portion of the image that is visible is what fits in the header area. You can change the focal point to adjust which portion of the image should be visible. After you set the focal point of the image, you should preview the survey and check how the survey header will look on a mobile device.
