# Add and configure satisfaction metrics

Organizations use various metrics to determine the effectiveness of the experiences they provide to their customers. They track a subset of these metrics daily, and this forms the basis for measuring their performance. These metrics, called *satisfaction metrics*, are measurement systems you can use to measure your customer experience. This ensures that the data you collect through surveys can be analyzed successfully, and you can make decisions accordingly.

Dynamics 365 Customer Voice includes support for adding the following standardized satisfaction metrics and mapping them to survey questions:

- **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**: NPS is a metric used to measure customer loyalty. The score is calculated from the NPS-type question by using a scale from 0 through 10. The respondents are grouped as follows:
  - **Detractors** are those who respond with a score from 0 through 6.
  - **Passives** are those who respond with a score of 7 or 8.
  - **Promoters** are those who respond with a score of 9 or 10.

  NPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters. The score is a number that can range from &ndash;100 to 100.

- **Sentiment**: Sentiment is a metric used to identify customer sentiment toward a product or a service. Sentiment groups the responses to a text-based question as positive, negative, or neutral. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > - Only a limited number of languages are supported for sentiment analysis. To know about the supported languages, see [What languages are supported for sentiment analysis?](cv-faq.md#what-languages-are-supported-for-sentiment-analysis).
    > - To learn about responsible AI use, see [Transparency note for Sentiment Analysis](/legal/cognitive-services/language-service/transparency-note-sentiment-analysis).

- **Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)**: CSAT is a metric used to measure the level of satisfaction customers have with a product or a service. CSAT is measured by responses to rating-type questions. The CSAT score is calculated on a scale of 1 to 5. If you create a question on a scale other than 1 to 5, the CSAT score is normalized as per the 1 to 5 scale. This helps in comparing various CSAT scores.

- **Custom score**: Custom score is a metric used to measure your respondent's overall satisfaction level by using survey scores. The value of this metric is generated by combining responses from multiple questions. More information: [Survey scoring](survey-scoring.md)

Satisfaction metrics are defined at the project level. If you create a project from one of the ready-to-use project templates in Dynamics 365 Customer Voice, satisfaction metrics are already created and mapped to survey questions. However, you can add more metrics as needed. If you create a project from the **Blank** project template, you need to add satisfaction metrics and map them to the questions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Projects, email templates, and satisfaction metrics are primarily based out of Microsoft DataVerse. Refreshing data on Dataverse environment with another will break Customer Voice projects and surveys on the refreshed environment. 

After you've received responses to your survey, a dashboard is created automatically for each set of metrics, showcasing recent scores and trends. The dashboard is available under **Reports** in the left pane. More information: [View a satisfaction metrics report](satisfaction-metrics-report.md)
