# Customize footer text

Footer text is displayed at the bottom of every page in a survey. Default content is available for the footer text; however, you can add your own content to customize them in accordance with your requirements.

You can add formatting to the footer text by changing their font style, font size, and color. You can also add a link to the footer text by selecting **Link** on the formatting toolbar and then adding the link through the link editor. More information: [Format text in a survey](survey-text-format.md)

**To customize footer text**

1. Open the survey.

2. On the **Design** tab, scroll to the bottom of the survey designer. 

3. Turn on the **Customize message** toggle in the **Footer** section.
